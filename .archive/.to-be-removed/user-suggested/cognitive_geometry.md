The Hartonomous Cognitive GeometryThis document describes the "Physics" of the semantic universe seeded by seed_cognitive_kernel.sql.1. The Reference Frame (Landmarks)To perform trilateration (mapping 1536d vectors to 3D coordinates), we define an orthogonal basis system.X-Axis: Abstract vs. ConcreteY-Axis: Technical vs. CreativeZ-Axis: Static vs. DynamicIn the seed script, these are represented by binary patterns 0x3F..., 0x40..., and 0xC0....2. The Semantic Topography (Seeded Clusters)We have manually mapped specific Atoms to 3D coordinates to create a testable "Reasoning Chain". This acts as a "Golden Path" for validating the A* algorithm.NodeContentCoordinates (X,Y,Z)Semantic RegionStart"Why is the server latency spiking?"(0, 0, 0)Problem SpaceStep 1"Logs show high disk I/O..."(3, 3, 0)ObservationStep 2"Backup overlaps with ETL..."(6, 6, 0)AnalysisGoal"Reschedule ETL job..."(10, 10, 0)Solution Space (Target)Noise"Mitochondria is powerhouse..."(-50, -50, 0)Biology Cluster3. Navigation Logic (A*)The stored procedure sp_GenerateOptimalPath calculates the route.Goal: The user provides a TargetConceptId. The system looks up provenance.Concepts to find the ConceptDomain (a Polygon geometry).Heuristic: Distance from current atom SpatialKey to the Concept's CentroidSpatialKey.Traversal: It queries AtomEmbedding using STIntersects with a radius. In our seed, the radius must be > 4.3 to bridge the gap between nodes (0,0 -> 3,3 is ~4.24 units).4. The OODA ConfigurationWe seeded InferenceRequests with a bimodal distribution:Background Radiation: Steady stream of 200ms requests (Normal).Anomaly Event: A burst of 2500ms requests in the last hour.Expected Agent Behavior:Observe: sp_AnalyzeSystem scans the last 24 hours.Orient: Calculates rolling average (~200ms) vs recent average (~2500ms).Decide: Flags this as a PerformanceAnomaly.Act: sp_Act should trigger a Hypothesis (e.g., "CacheWarming" or "IndexOptimization").
