# Hartonomous Documentation

Welcome to the official documentation for Hartonomous, a next-generation reasoning engine built entirely on the Microsoft SQL Server platform.

This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the system's architecture, core concepts, and operational procedures. It is sourced from the definitive "Rewrite Guide" and represents the modern vision for the project.

## Navigation

To get started, please explore the following sections:

*   **[Getting Started](./getting-started/00-quickstart.md):** A guide to quickly setting up a development environment and running your first queries.
*   **[Architecture](./architecture/00-principles.md):** A deep dive into the foundational principles and core components of the Hartonomous engine. This is the best place to understand the *why* behind the system.
*   **[Implementation](./implementation/01-sql-schema.md):** Detailed explanations of the SQL schema, T-SQL pipelines, and the SQL CLR functions that power the system.

## Core Concepts

The Hartonomous engine is built on three revolutionary concepts:

1.  **[Semantic-First Architecture](./architecture/01-semantic-first-architecture.md):** A novel approach that transforms high-dimensional vector search into a highly efficient spatial indexing problem, enabling unprecedented performance on commodity hardware.
2.  **[OODA Autonomous Loop](./architecture/02-ooda-autonomous-loop.md):** A closed-loop, self-optimizing system that allows the database to autonomously reason, act, and learn, forming the basis for its emergent intelligence.
3.  **[Entropy Geometry](./architecture/03-entropy-geometry.md):** The theoretical foundation for the system's advanced dimensionality reduction and model compression techniques.
