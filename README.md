# Hartonomous

> **Database-native AI inference platform with SQL Server 2025 vector search, multimodal embeddings, and graph provenance**

Hartonomous treats your SQL Server 2025 database as a first-class AI inference engine. Models decompose into queryable rows, embeddings leverage native VECTOR types with spatial hybrid search, and provenance flows through Service Broker into Neo4j for full lineage tracking. The platform ships with atomic content deduplication, CLR-accelerated vector operations, usage-based billing, and production-ready worker services.

## Why Hartonomous?

- **Database-is-the-model architecture**: AI models decompose into queryable SQL rows; inference runs entirely in T-SQL using native VECTOR operations
- **Hybrid vector search**: Spatial indexes (GEOMETRY) provide O(log n) filtering, then exact vector distance reranks top candidates for 10-100x performance gains
- **Atomic content storage**: Content-addressable atoms (SHA-256) with reference counting eliminate duplicate storage across text, image, audio, video
- **CLR provenance types**: Custom UDTs (AtomicStream, ComponentStream) serialize generation history with full bill-of-materials tracking
- **SQL-native inference**: Ensemble queries, semantic search, spatial generation all execute as stored procedures with aggregate vector operations
- **Event-driven graph sync**: Service Broker + Neo4j workers maintain dual representation (SQL for queries, Neo4j for graph algorithms)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- SQL Server 2025 with vector and spatial features enabled (`VECTOR`, `GEOMETRY`, SQL Service Broker)
- .NET 10 SDK
- Neo4j 5.x
- PowerShell 7+ (for scripts)
- Optional: Azure Event Hubs (or another CloudEvents-compatible broker)

### First Run

```powershell
# Clone and enter the repo
git clone https://github.com/AHartTN/Hartonomous.git
cd Hartonomous

# Restore tools and build
dotnet restore Hartonomous.sln
dotnet build Hartonomous.sln

# Apply database schema (includes billing tables)
dotnet ef database update --project src/Hartonomous.Data --startup-project src/Hartonomous.Infrastructure

# Seed foundational data (atoms, models, rate plans)
./scripts/deploy-database.ps1 -ServerName "localhost" -DatabaseName "Hartonomous" -TrustedConnection $true -Seed $true

# Run the Neo4j projection worker
cd src/Neo4jSync

### 🚧 **In Progress - Client Layer Development**

The platform has been built **inside-out**: database engine first, client interfaces next. The core SQL-native inference, provenance tracking, billing, and worker services are production-ready. Client-facing layers are the next major push.

#### External Embedder Integration

- ⚠️ ITextEmbedder, IImageEmbedder, IAudioEmbedder, IVideoEmbedder interfaces defined
- ⚠️ No production implementations yet (placeholder TF-IDF in sp_TextToEmbedding for text)
- ⚠️ EmbeddingIngestionService stores/searches embeddings but doesn't generate them

**Current Access Pattern**: Pre-compute embeddings externally (OpenAI API, local CLIP/Wav2Vec2 models) and ingest via EmbeddingService, or use SQL Server ML Services with Python/R to call embedding models inside stored procedures.

**Next Steps**: Implement embedder wrappers for OpenAI, Azure Cognitive Services, local ONNX models.

#### Public API Layer & Admin Interface

- ⚠️ DTOs defined in `Hartonomous.Api/DTOs/` (GenerationRequest, EmbeddingRequest, SearchRequest, etc.)
- ⚠️ No REST API controllers/endpoints yet
- ⚠️ No gRPC service definitions
- ⚠️ No API authentication/authorization middleware
- ⚠️ No OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
- ⚠️ Blazor Admin UI scaffolded (model browser, ingestion, extraction pages) but incomplete

**Current Access Pattern**: Direct database connections (SQL Server Management Studio, Azure Data Studio), ModelIngestion CLI, partial Blazor Admin UI.

**Next Steps**: Build REST/gRPC thin client API with authentication, complete Blazor Admin UI for administration and testing workflows.

#### Inference Result Parsing

- ⚠️ InferenceOrchestrator.EnsembleInferenceAsync returns placeholder confidence scores
- ⚠️ InferenceRequests table populated by stored procedures, but C# orchestrator doesn't parse T-SQL output sets

**Current Access Pattern**: Service Broker messages and Neo4j provenance graph capture full inference lineage. Query `InferenceRequests`/`InferenceSteps` tables directly for execution metadata.

**Next Steps**: Implement InferenceRepository to parse stored procedure result sets and correlate with C# response objects.

#### Multimodal Generation

- ✅ Image generation: Retrieval-guided spatial diffusion with patch-based composition via CLR functions
- ✅ Audio generation: Retrieval-based segment composition or synthetic harmonic tone generation
- ✅ Video generation: Temporal frame recombination from retrieved clips with synthetic fallback
- ✅ CLR generation functions: `clr_GenerateImagePatches`, `clr_GenerateImageGeometry`, `clr_GenerateHarmonicTone`, `clr_AudioToWaveform`

### 🔮 **Future Capabilities** (Post Client-Layer)

Once the API/Admin interfaces are complete, the roadmap includes:

- **Real-time streaming inference**: Model supports streaming flag (`ModelCapabilities.SupportsStreaming`), but no IAsyncEnumerable token stream implementation yet
- **Enhanced multi-tenant isolation**: TenantId tracked in BillingRatePlans and access policies, but no row-level security policies or SESSION_CONTEXT enforcement yet
- **Automated quantization pipelines**: `ModelLayer.QuantizationType/QuantizationScale/QuantizationZeroPoint` columns exist, but no INT8/INT4 compression automation
- **Model versioning/rollback**: No version tracking or temporal snapshots - single current version per model
- **A/B testing framework**: No experiment tracking or variant comparison infrastructure
- **Federated learning**: No distributed model update aggregation or edge deployment support
- **Distributed inference**: No cross-instance partitioned execution or sharding strategy
