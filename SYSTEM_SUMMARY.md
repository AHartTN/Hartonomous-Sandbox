# Hartonomous - Cognitive Database System

## Executive Summary

Hartonomous is a **cognitive database system** that treats SQL Server 2025 as an AI inference engine. Instead of storing models as binary blobs and running inference externally, the database structure itself performs inference through novel exploitation of native SQL Server capabilities.

### Core Innovation

**Traditional Approach:**
- Models stored as files
- Inference requires VRAM and external runtime
- Vector databases store pre-computed embeddings
- Retraining required for updates

**Hartonomous Approach:**
- Models decomposed into queryable database rows
- Inference = spatial/graph navigation through indexed relationships
- Dual representation (VECTOR + GEOMETRY) for exact and approximate search
- Student models extracted via T-SQL SELECT statements
- Zero VRAM inference using disk-based spatial indexes

---

## System Architecture

### 1. SQL Server 2025 RC1 - Primary Inference Engine

**Native Features Exploited:**
- `VECTOR` datatype for high-dimensional embeddings (768D, 1536D)
- `GEOMETRY` datatype for spatial projection and indexed queries
- `COLUMNSTORE` indexes for temporal/sequential data
- Spatial indexes with 4-level hierarchical indexing
- Change Data Capture (CDC) for audit trails

**Novel Implementation:**
- **Dual Representation:** Every embedding stored as both VECTOR(768) and GEOMETRY(3D)
  - VECTOR: Exact similarity via VECTOR_DISTANCE (O(n))
  - GEOMETRY: Approximate via spatial index (O(log n))
  - Hybrid: Spatial filter → Vector rerank (best of both)

- **Models as Rows:** Transformer weights stored as queryable VECTOR rows
  ```sql
  -- Each attention head weight is a database row
  SELECT weight_vector, importance_score
  FROM AttentionWeights
  WHERE layer_id = 2 AND head_idx = 5;
  ```

- **Spatial = Neural Operations:**
  - STDistance() replaces dot product
  - Spatial nearest-neighbor replaces attention mechanism
  - No matrix multiplication needed

### 2. Neo4j 2.0.5 - Semantic Audit Trail

**Purpose:** Complete provenance tracking for AI decisions

**Data Synced:**
- Document nodes with embeddings
- Inference request nodes with timing
- Model contribution relationships
- Decision reasoning chains

**Real-time Sync:** .NET 10 worker service polling every 5 seconds

### 3. .NET 10 Services

**ModelIngestion Service:**
- Decomposes models into atomic components
- Stores weights as VECTOR database rows
- Calculates importance scores for pruning

**EmbeddingIngestion Service:**
- Generates embeddings (or accepts external)
- Applies dimensionality reduction (PCA/UMAP)
- Dual insertion: VECTOR + GEOMETRY

**Neo4jSync Worker:**
- Background service syncing SQL → Neo4j
- Captures inference operations for explainability

## Key Capabilities Demonstrated

### 1. Dual Representation Strategy
```sql
-- Exact search (high precision)
SELECT TOP 10 *
FROM Embeddings_Production
ORDER BY VECTOR_DISTANCE('cosine', embedding_full, @query);

-- Approximate search (high speed)
SELECT TOP 10 *
FROM Embeddings_Production
ORDER BY spatial_geometry.STDistance(@query_point);

-- Hybrid (best of both)
-- Stage 1: Spatial filter 1000 candidates
-- Stage 2: Vector rerank to top 10
```

### 2. Models as Queryable Data
```sql
-- Find most important attention heads across ALL models
SELECT model_id, head_idx, importance_score, weight_vector
FROM AttentionWeights
WHERE importance_score > 0.9
ORDER BY importance_score DESC;

-- Compare weight distributions between models
SELECT model_id, AVG(importance_score), STDEV(importance_score)
FROM AttentionWeights
GROUP BY model_id;
```

### 3. Student Models via SELECT
```sql
-- Extract 30% of parent model (highest importance weights)
EXEC sp_DynamicStudentExtraction
    @parent_model_id = 1,
    @target_size_ratio = 0.3,
    @selection_strategy = 'importance';

-- Result: Instant knowledge distillation
-- No training loop, no gradient descent
-- Pure data query
```

### 4. Cognitive Activation Pattern
```sql
-- Query "activates" nodes like neurons firing
EXEC sp_CognitiveActivation
    @query_embedding = @vector,
    @activation_threshold = 0.8;

-- Returns nodes with activation strength
-- Simulates neural network forward pass
-- Using indexed lookups instead of matrix operations
```

### 5. Cross-Modal Inference
```sql
-- Query across any modality using spatial coordinates
EXEC sp_CrossModalQuery
    @spatial_query_x = 0.5,
    @spatial_query_y = -0.3,
    @modality_filter = NULL; -- All modalities
```

## Novel Paradigms Demonstrated

### 1. Database = Model
The database structure IS the model. Relationships and indexes encode knowledge. Query paths represent inference.

### 2. Inference = Lookup
No forward pass through layers. Instead: spatial navigation through pre-calculated weight relationships.

### 3. Storage = Computation
Data structure performs computation. STDistance() replaces matrix multiplication.

### 4. Student Models = Subqueries
Extract compressed models via SELECT. Instant distillation without training.

### 5. Zero VRAM Inference
Only active query path loads. Database pages cached. No GPU required.
