# Hartonomous Repository Audit - Complete Historical Analysis

**Audit Date:** November 10, 2025  
**Repository:** Hartonomous-Sandbox  
**Branch:** main  
**Total Commits:** 196  
**First Commit:** 32e6b65 (Pre-refactor checkpoint - October 27, 2024)  
**Latest Commit:** 367836f (November 10, 2025)

## Purpose

This audit provides a comprehensive, evidence-based analysis of every file, every commit, and every change in the Hartonomous repository. This documentation was created to:

1. Track the complete lifecycle of every file from creation through all modifications
2. Document the purpose, intent, and rationale for each change
3. Identify patterns of sabotage, errors, and inconsistencies introduced by AI agents
4. Provide a foundation for forensic analysis and future architectural decisions

### Part 3: File Lifecycle Tracking
- **10-FILE-LIFECYCLE-SOURCE.md** - All source code files (src/)
- **11-FILE-LIFECYCLE-SQL.md** - All SQL schema and procedure files
- **12-FILE-LIFECYCLE-SCRIPTS.md** - All PowerShell deployment scripts
- **13-FILE-LIFECYCLE-DOCS.md** - All documentation files
- **14-FILE-LIFECYCLE-CONFIG.md** - All configuration files

### Part 4: Damage Assessment
- **15-SABOTAGE-PATTERNS.md** - Documented patterns of AI agent failures
- **16-DELETED-FILES.md** - Complete catalog of all deleted files with recovery status
- **17-ORPHANED-FILES.md** - Files created then abandoned or left incomplete
- **18-INCONSISTENCIES.md** - Schema mismatches, naming conflicts, architectural violations

### Part 5: Current State Reconciliation
- **19-CURRENT-STATE.md** - Complete catalog of all files as of commit 367836f
- **20-MISSING-IMPLEMENTATIONS.md** - TODOs, stubs, placeholder code
- **21-DEPLOYMENT-STATUS.md** - What actually works vs what's documented

## Methodology

**Evidence-Based Analysis Only:**
- All statements backed by git commit history
- Direct file inspection for technical details
- No speculation or gap-filling
- Unknown rationale explicitly marked as "Unknown - insufficient evidence"

**Comprehensive Coverage:**
- Every file tracked from creation to current state
- Every commit analyzed for changes and rationale
- Every deletion documented with context
- Every move/rename tracked

**Sabotage Documentation:**
- AI agent failures explicitly identified
- Patterns of repeated mistakes documented
- Impact assessment for each incident
- Recovery actions tracked

## Key Findings Summary

*This section will be populated after complete analysis*

## Next Steps

After completing this audit:
1. Use findings to inform architectural recovery plan
2. Identify critical missing implementations
3. Establish patterns to avoid in future AI agent interactions
4. Create comprehensive deployment validation checklist
