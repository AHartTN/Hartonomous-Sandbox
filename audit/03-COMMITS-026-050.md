### Assessment

**Architectural Shift:**
- ✅ Dimension bucket approach is SQL Server-specific optimization
- ✅ Recognizes that VECTOR columns of different sizes need different tables
- ✅ Technical justification in DIMENSION_BUCKET_RATIONALE.md

**Clean Architecture Enforcement:**
- ✅ Removed services from Core layer (DDD violation)
- ✅ Services belong in Infrastructure or Application layer
- ✅ Core should only contain entities, value objects, interfaces

**Code Quality:**
- ✅ Net -1,488 lines (removed unnecessary abstraction)
- ✅ Replaced generic providers with specific repositories
- ✅ Cleaner separation of concerns

**Sabotage Pattern:**
- ⚠️ Commit message: "claude hit session limit quickly"
- Evidence: AI agent (Claude) ran out of quota mid-work
- Human (Tony) had to take over and complete manually
- This explains major refactoring vs incremental changes

**Claude Settings:**
- `.claude/settings.local.json` modified (3 lines changed)
- Likely: Adjusted Claude configuration after hitting limits

**Status:** Major architectural pivot, significant cleanup, human intervention required

## Commit 030: e846e02 - Update model readers to use GEOMETRY LINESTRING ZM for weight storage

**Date:** October 30, 2024 (time unknown)  
**Message:** "Update model readers to use GEOMETRY LINESTRING ZM for weight storage"

### Changes

**Model Readers Updated:**
- OnnxModelReader, PyTorchModelReader, SafetensorsModelReader, GGUFModelReader
- All now output weights as GEOMETRY LINESTRING ZM

**LINESTRING ZM Format:**
- LINESTRING: Sequence of points
- Z: Third dimension (weight values)
- M: Fourth dimension (measure - likely weight metadata)

**Example:**
```sql
GEOMETRY::STLineFromText('LINESTRING ZM (0 0 0.5 1, 1 0 0.3 2, 2 0 0.8 3)', 0)
```
- Each point: (layer_index, position, weight_value, metadata)

### Assessment

**Technical Depth:**
- ✅ Using 4D geometry (X, Y, Z, M) for weight storage
- ✅ Allows multi-dimensional spatial queries
- ✅ Z dimension holds actual weight values
- ✅ M dimension holds metadata (gradient info, update count, etc.)

**Implications:**
- Weight matrices become spatial line segments
- Convolution kernels become point clouds
- Attention weights become spatial relationships

**Validation:**
- This is the core of "Indexes ARE Models" vision
- Spatial indexes enable fast weight access
- No need to load full model into memory

**Status:** All model readers standardized on GEOMETRY output
