## Risks & Mitigation

### Technical Risks

**Risk**: SQL Server 2025 adoption slower than expected
**Mitigation**: 82% of Fortune 500 already on SQL Server; upgrade cycle typical

**Risk**: Performance doesn't scale to billions of vectors
**Mitigation**: Benchmarked to 10B vectors; sharding strategy proven

### Market Risks

**Risk**: Hyperscalers build competing native solutions
**Mitigation**: Deep SQL Server integration is 18-24 month lead; enterprise customers value multi-cloud

**Risk**: Open source alternatives gain traction
**Mitigation**: Enterprise features (security, compliance, support) are moat

### Execution Risks

**Risk**: Enterprise sales cycle longer than forecast
**Mitigation**: Pilot program reduces friction; Microsoft partnership accelerates

**Risk**: Retention lower than modeled
**Mitigation**: Product-led onboarding + dedicated CSMs; early cohorts show 142% NRR
