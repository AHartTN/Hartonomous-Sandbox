# Hartonomous Documentation Index

Welcome to the new documentation set.  The goal is to keep a small number of living documents that stay aligned with the platform.  Each guide below is curated to cover a different audience or responsibility.

| Document | Audience | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Business Overview](business-overview.md) | Product, GTM, leadership | Value proposition, personas, pricing, and roadmap themes |
| [Technical Architecture](technical-architecture.md) | Engineering, architects | Service layout, messaging flow, storage models, and component decision log |
| [Deployment & Operations](deployment-and-operations.md) | SRE, DevOps | Environment preparation, migration cadence, broker setup, monitoring, and runbooks |
| [Development Handbook](development-handbook.md) | Contributors | Local environment, coding standards, testing expectations, and review process |
| [Billing Model](billing-model.md) | Product, finance, engineering | Schema reference for rate plans, multipliers, ledger entries, and integration touch points |

## Keeping Docs Current

1. Update docs as part of the same pull request that changes behaviour.
2. Prefer small, concrete sections instead of sprawling encyclopedias.
3. When something becomes obsolete, delete it rather than letting it rot.
4. Use TODO markers sparingly and track open gaps in the issue tracker.

Need something that is not captured here?  Propose an addition in `#hartonomous-core` or file an issue — the team will keep this index tight and relevant.
