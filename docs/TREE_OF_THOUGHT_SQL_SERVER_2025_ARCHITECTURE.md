# Tree-of-Thought: SQL Server 2025 Architecture Analysis

## The Question

**Are we leveraging SQL Server 2025's revolutionary features optimally?**

Features available:
1. **VECTOR type + DiskANN indexes**
2. **Graph tables (NODE/EDGE)**
3. **Columnstore indexes**
4. **Spatial indexes (GEOMETRY)**
5. **JSON indexes**
6. **Temporal tables**

---

## Path 1: VECTOR + DiskANN (Current Approach)

### What We're Doing
```sql
CREATE TABLE Weights_768 (
    weight_vector VECTOR(768),
    ...
)
CREATE VECTOR INDEX idx_diskann ON Weights_768(weight_vector) USING DISKANN
```

### Pros
- ✅ Native vector similarity (VECTOR_DISTANCE)
- ✅ DiskANN navigation for billion-scale search
- ✅ Index-only scans possible
- ✅ Aligns with "database IS the model" vision

### Cons
- ⚠️ Fixed dimension per table (requires buckets)
- ⚠️ Table becomes READ-ONLY after VECTOR INDEX created
- ⚠️ Max 1998 (float32) or 3996 (float16) dimensions

### Verdict
**ESSENTIAL** - This is the core of the vision

---

## Path 2: Graph Tables for Model Topology

### What We COULD Do
```sql
CREATE TABLE Layer AS NODE (
    layer_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    layer_type NVARCHAR(50),  -- 'attention', 'feedforward', etc.
    layer_idx INT
)

CREATE TABLE Connection AS EDGE
-- Represents: Layer → next Layer connections

-- Query model topology:
SELECT l1.layer_type, l2.layer_type
FROM Layer l1, Connection, Layer l2
WHERE MATCH(l1-(Connection)->l2)
```

### Pros
- ✅ Natural representation of neural network topology
- ✅ Graph queries for layer dependencies
- ✅ Could model attention patterns as edges
- ✅ Cypher-like queries in T-SQL

### Cons
- ⚠️ Overhead for simple sequential models (BERT = just 12 sequential layers)
- ⚠️ More valuable for complex architectures (ResNet skip connections, multi-head attention)
- ⚠️ Adds complexity if topology is static

### Questions to Answer
1. **Do we need to QUERY topology dynamically?**
   - Or is it just metadata?
2. **Are skip connections/residuals important?**
   - ResNet, Transformers have them
3. **Does this enable new capabilities?**
   - Student model extraction by graph traversal?

### Current Assessment
**MAYBE** - Useful for complex architectures, overkill for simple ones
**Decision**: Start without it, add when ingesting complex models

---

## Path 3: Columnstore for Sequential Weight Data

### What We COULD Do
```sql
CREATE TABLE WeightSequences (
    model_id INT,
    layer_idx INT,
    position INT,
    weight_value FLOAT,
    INDEX idx_columnstore CLUSTERED COLUMNSTORE
)
```

### Pros
- ✅ 10-100x compression for sequential data
- ✅ Perfect for recurrent/temporal patterns
- ✅ Fast aggregation queries (SUM, AVG over weights)

### Cons
- ❌ **INCOMPATIBLE WITH VECTOR TYPE!**
  - Can't have VECTOR(768) in columnstore
  - Would need to decompose vectors into rows (1 row per float)
- ❌ Loses vector operations (VECTOR_DISTANCE)
- ❌ **Defeats entire purpose**

### Mathematical Analysis

**Option A: Vector as single value**
```sql
weight_vector VECTOR(768)  -- Single 768-dim value
```
- Native vector ops ✅
- DiskANN ✅
- Columnstore ❌

**Option B: Decompose to floats**
```sql
position INT (0-767)
weight_value FLOAT
```
- Columnstore ✅
- Vector ops ❌
- 768x more rows ❌

### Verdict
**REJECT for weight storage** - Conflicts with VECTOR type
**POSSIBLE for activation sequences** - If storing inference traces

---

## Path 4: Spatial Index for Inference Navigation

### Current Plan
```sql
-- After UMAP projection: 768D → 3D
CREATE SPATIAL INDEX idx_spatial
ON Embeddings(spatial_projection)
```

### Pros
- ✅ Fast approximate search via STDistance
- ✅ Hierarchical 4-level grid
- ✅ Could enable "spatial reasoning" over weights
- ✅ Complements exact VECTOR search

### Questions
1. **Projection consistency across dimensions?**
   - UMAP on 768-dim vs 1536-dim → same 3D space?
   - Answer: NO - projections are data-dependent

2. **Use case for spatial on weights?**
   - For embeddings: YES (semantic similarity in 3D)
   - For model weights: UNCLEAR

### Refined Approach
- **Embeddings**: UMAP → 3D → Spatial index (for visualization/approximate search)
- **Weights**: VECTOR index only (exact operations)

### Verdict
**YES for embeddings**, **NO for weights**

---

## Path 5: JSON Indexes for Metadata

### What We're Doing
```sql
CREATE TABLE ModelArchitecture (
    architecture_config NVARCHAR(MAX)  -- JSON
)
```

### What We COULD Do
```sql
CREATE TABLE ModelArchitecture (
    architecture_config NVARCHAR(MAX)
)
CREATE INDEX idx_json_metadata
ON ModelArchitecture(architecture_config)
-- Requires: parsing JSON, indexing specific paths
```

### Use Cases
- Fast queries on config properties
- Filter models by architecture details

### Current Assessment
**LOW PRIORITY** - Metadata queries are rare
**Defer until needed**

---

## Path 6: Temporal Tables for Model Versioning

### What We COULD Do
```sql
CREATE TABLE ModelArchitecture (
    ...
    valid_from DATETIME2 GENERATED ALWAYS AS ROW START,
    valid_to DATETIME2 GENERATED ALWAYS AS ROW END,
    PERIOD FOR SYSTEM_TIME (valid_from, valid_to)
)
WITH (SYSTEM_VERSIONING = ON)
```

### Pros
- ✅ Automatic versioning of model configs
- ✅ Query historical states
- ✅ Rollback capabilities

### Cons
- ⚠️ Models are relatively static after ingestion
- ⚠️ Version control likely handled externally (git)

### Verdict
**DEFER** - Not critical for MVP

---

## Synthesis: Optimal Architecture

### Core (Essential)
1. **VECTOR type with dimension buckets** ← DOING THIS
   - Tables: 128, 256, 384, 512, 768, 1024, 1536, 1998
   - DiskANN indexes after ingestion
   - Read-only tables for performance

2. **VectorUtilities** for shared operations ← DONE

3. **Routing layer** (ModelArchitectureService) ← DONE

### Phase 2 (High Value)
4. **Spatial indexes for embeddings**
   - UMAP: high-dim → 3D
   - Dual representation: VECTOR (exact) + GEOMETRY (approx)
   - Hybrid search: spatial filter → vector rerank

5. **Graph tables for complex models**
   - Add when ingesting ResNet/multi-path architectures
   - Not needed for simple sequential models

### Phase 3 (Nice to Have)
6. **Temporal tables** for audit trails
7. **JSON indexes** if metadata queries become frequent

### Never
8. ~~**Columnstore for weights**~~ - Conflicts with VECTOR type

---

## Real-World Embedding Dimensions (Updated)

Based on research of production models:

### Tier 1: Essential Support (covers 95% of models)
```sql
CREATE TABLE Weights_128   -- BERT-Tiny, efficient models
CREATE TABLE Weights_256   -- Efficient models, Google Vertex AI
CREATE TABLE Weights_384   -- MiniLM (very popular for production)
CREATE TABLE Weights_512   -- CLIP, ResNet vision models
CREATE TABLE Weights_768   -- BERT-Base, GPT-2 (MOST COMMON)
CREATE TABLE Weights_1024  -- BERT-Large, GPT-2 Medium
CREATE TABLE Weights_1536  -- OpenAI ada-002
CREATE TABLE Weights_1998  -- Max float32 (catch-all)
```

### Tier 2: Large Models (require special handling)
- 4096, 5120, 8192 (LLaMA) → Exceed SQL Server limits
- 12288 (GPT-3) → Far beyond limits

**Solution for >1998**: Chunking or VARBINARY storage with spatial projection

---

## Decision Tree

```
Model Ingestion
├─ What dimension?
│  ├─ 128-1536 → Dimension bucket table ✅
│  ├─ 1536-1998 → Weights_1998 (float32) ✅
│  ├─ 1998-3996 → Weights_3996 (float16) ⚠️
│  └─ >3996 → Chunking strategy 🔧
│
├─ What topology?
│  ├─ Sequential (BERT, GPT) → Simple table refs ✅
│  └─ Complex (ResNet, DAG) → Graph tables 🔧
│
└─ What storage?
   ├─ Weights → VECTOR type ✅
   ├─ Embeddings → VECTOR + GEOMETRY (dual) ✅
   └─ Activations → Possible columnstore 🔧
```

Legend:
- ✅ Implement now
- ⚠️ Plan for but defer
- 🔧 Design but don't implement yet

## Questions for User

1. **Should we support ALL dimension buckets (128-1998)?**
   - Or focus on top 4-5 most common (384, 512, 768, 1024, 1536)?

2. **Priority: Graph tables for topology?**
   - Important now or defer until complex models?

3. **Large models (LLaMA 4096+)**:
   - Implement chunking now or focus on <1998 first?

4. **Columnstore anywhere?**
   - Inference traces/activations?
   - Or skip entirely?

---

## Conclusion

**Current approach is CORRECT** for core vision:
- VECTOR type ✅
- Dimension buckets ✅
- DiskANN indexes ✅

**Next priorities**:
1. Support REAL dimensions (add 128, 256, 384, 512)
2. Dual representation (VECTOR + GEOMETRY)
3. Graph tables (when needed)

**Do NOT use**:
- Columnstore for weights (conflicts with VECTOR)
- Generic padding (wastes storage)
- VARBINARY for <1998 dims (loses vector ops)
