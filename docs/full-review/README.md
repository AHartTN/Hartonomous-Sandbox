# README.md

## Purpose and Context

- Top-level repository overview marketing Hartonomous as an enterprise-grade autonomous AI system running inside SQL Server.
- Mixes architecture description, quick-start instructions, project structure, documentation links, and promotional copy.

## Structure and Content

- Presents layered architecture (storage, computation, intelligence, autonomous) interwoven with ASCII art diagrams and marketing statements.
- Provides prerequisites, setup steps, Docker instructions, and sample SQL/PowerShell usage, though formatting is heavily corrupted with duplicated sections and inline annotations.
- Lists documentation references, project structure, performance claims, feature breakdowns, and contributing/support information.
- Contains multiple conflicting license statements (MIT references vs proprietary LICENSE), reflecting inconsistent cleanup.

## Notable Details

- File appears corrupted: headings and paragraphs are duplicated, markdown syntax broken (`# Hartonomous# Hartonomous# Hartonomous`, mixed inline ASCII art), and sections repeat verbatim with mismatched formatting.
- References non-existent or removed components (`Hartonomous.Sql.Bridge`, ModelIngestion console app) and outdated technology targets (".NET 10", "SQL Server 2025").
- Claims deployment automation exists but simultaneously directs readers to manual scripts and `KNOWN_ISSUES.md`.
- Presents contradictory status sections (implementation 85% complete) and marketing-heavy language that may mislead consumers about actual project readiness.

## Potential Risks / Follow-ups

- Requires significant cleanup to restore readable markdown: remove duplication, fix headings, and ensure consistent structure.
- Update technical details to reflect current repository state—verify referenced projects, frameworks, and deployment steps.
- Resolve license inconsistency: README cites MIT while `LICENSE` file declares proprietary terms.
- Reduce marketing hype in favor of factual, maintainable documentation focused on setup, architecture, and contribution guidelines.
